or "many_one."}

\item{height}{The proportion the point takes in the shaded area.}

\item{width}{The number that controls the runif_max to specify how far apart each point is.}

A modified animbook object with additional data components
}
\description{
This function performs data manipulation and formatting tasks
from the original object with additional data components for labeling and shading.
}
\details{
The function takes the animbook object and then subsets the data based on the users.
Additionally, it creates a label data and shading data for the \code{\link[=wallaby_plot]{wallaby_plot()}} function. All
of this then replaced the original data and appended new data to the object.
